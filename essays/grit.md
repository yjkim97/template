I'm a firm believer in the saying "When there's a will, there's a way." Many people seem to think that this quote means "If there is hope, that's all you need." Sadly, hope is not all someone needs to succeed. 

I spent a few years training to become an officer in the Air Force, and I am still currently in training. The Air Force evaluates cadets on numerous different factors such as physical fitness, knowledge, drill and ceremonies, etc. No one starts as an expert in any of these catagories, but they all end up very proficient at it at some point in their careers.

Not all cadets make it through. Some find that the training environment isn't for them. Some get disqualified for medical reasons. But the greatest reason why most people drop out is their lack of grit.

Those who are usually ranked lower in their group have a tendency to become complacent. They believe it is alright to strive for the minimum. They believe that with the effort they are putting now, they will still end up in the worlds greatest Air Force. However, they quickly come to realize that the military can not afford to have mediocre people. They also realize that without the work ethic, they do not have the motivation to work harder. Soon, they drop out and find another career.

You may be thinking, what does this have to do with anything? When it comes to programming and the subject of Computer Science, I felt that grit also plays a big role. Learning Computer Science takes a lot of time and effort. New things are being discovered every day due to its very young age, and it's one of the few sciences that is man made. One can not become a great programmer over night, and it takes consistant motivation and effort to become a great programmer.

There were many times when I wanted to pull my hair out because I've stared at the computer screen for 12 hours and made no progress. I am absolutely sure that every single computer scientist out there can relate to this feeling, because we've all been through it. However, I believe that that is what makes this field so great. Everyone goes through hardship, and those that make it out alive are a force to be reckoned with. When there's a will, there is a way, and the will to become a programmer is the driving force behind successful computer scientists.
