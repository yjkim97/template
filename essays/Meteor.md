## Meteor

<img class="ui medium left floated image" src="https://guide.meteor.com/images/logo-coralspace-left.svg">
I spent two weeks in my software engineering class learning how to use Meteor. Meteor is a developer tool that builds applications and web pages. Although I was not completely sure how Meteor worked, it seemed to build applications like magic. After writing some HTML and JavaScript code, all I would have to do was run or refresh Meteor and it would take care of everything else. The fact that I could use Meteor without fully understanding what it does is what impressed me the most. The userability of a program really gets tested when someone can use it without knowing exactly what to do. 

## Challenges
I think that the hardest part of the past two weeks wasnâ€™t how to use Meteor, but the coding aspect of web applications. I felt that using Meteor to do installations and run code was simple enough. The hardest part was trying to figure out how a code will compile and affect the web page. Software engineering and application architecture is something that is definitely foreign to what I am used to. It is incredibly hard to visualize how to get a certain functionality because so many different aspects affect each other. JavaScript code may affect an HTML file that imported another JavaScript code that has a function used in another HTML code, which is why it is so much more difficult to handle.

Overall, I think that Meteor is an amazing developer tool. The fact that in can build applications and refresh itself so seamlessly makes it an absolutely required tool for software engineering. I am almost certain that with more time and effort, I could learn and unlock Meteors greater potentials.
