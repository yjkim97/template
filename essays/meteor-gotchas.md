## Meteor

Meteor isn’t for everyone, but it can be for everyone. Meteor is a simple tool that is used to design and build webpages. It can be challenging to use at times, but there are so many benefits of using meteor. I have never run into any problems with meteor during the Digits creation, but here are my experiences with it.

The meteor program runs very slow and takes a long time to start up. Although it wasn’t a severe problem, I believe that if the program is used in a good amount of time, it would never be an issue. I usually do my homework and practice WOD’s towards the end of the night, so the fact the Meteor takes 5 gazillion years to start and do “meteor NPM install” is a big problem.

Another problem I ran into Meteor is that it does not give any explanations on the code. Sometimes the terminal will just tell me it was unable to compile the code, but it lacks to show any meaning behind why. That means that if there was anything wrong with my code, I am not able to find out what it is by just looking at the client. Sometimes, the bug is as simple as missing a spelling or forgetting to import something. Meteor often allows these things to happen and does not check them on the spot. 

Either way, Meteor isn’t for everyone. It’s difficult to use, but once someone decides to learn it, it can be used by everyone that intends to build applications and webpages, as long as there is enough time to run meteor npm install..
