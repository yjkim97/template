There are a lot of things that people can invest in to make their lives easier in the future. In South Korea, there is a saying that goes something along the lines of “Suffer for 16 years and live the rest of your life in peace.” This phrase tells young students to dedicate their youth to their studies until they get their degrees so that they can have more opportunities in their adulthood. There are definitely certain things in life that time and effort is worth investing. Investing in Bitcoins in 2007 could have made me a millionaire today. Taking the time to learn the foundations of Spanish in 101 and 102 would have made my life a whole lot easier in my current Spanish 201 class. Learning to use the VI editor efficiently is a million times better and more effective than writing programs on a notepad. Some would even argue that learning Semantic UI and UI Frameworks would be a lot more effective than using HTML and CSS.

UI Frameworks is a lot like VI editor. VI editor is very hard to get used to. It is much different than a normal text editor and the hotkeys in VI makes it even more confusing. When I first started, it was hard for me to even start typing because I didn’t know how to control where my input cursor went. However, those that take the time to learn VI have never seemed to regret it. The time they spent learning the editor really becomes worth it when more time is saved while using the program to write code. Kind of like how buying a solar panel for your water heater and electricity may cost a lot, but careful consumption after can allow your bills to be exponentially low for the next decade or more, paying it of on its own. UI Frameworks is just like that. The time spent on learning is can save tons of time spent on trying to code with raw HTML or CSS. 

So is it beneficial? If you’re planning to design web pages often in the next few years, months, or even weeks, UI Frameworks is undoubtly the way to go.
