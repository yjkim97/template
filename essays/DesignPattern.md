## Designs? Patterns?

When I first heard of the term “design patterns”, I thought that it had something to do with art or architecture. Patterns that involved an aesthetically pleasing look that I could implement into the landing page for my application. After losing points on my final project in my ICS 314 class for my poor visuals, I thought that I would be learning more about what patterns are socially acceptable to use as designs. Boy was I wrong.n conclusion, Javascript has been very pleasant to use so far. It offered create things I liked from Java such as object oriented programming, but made it a lot easier. Learning Javascript makes me eager to expand my knowledge on other languages so that I can be exposed to how efficient things could be. 

## Nope.

Turns out design patterns is something extraordinarily different. The concept of design patterns revolves around a collection of best practices that pioneers in that field have accepted as the easiest, most general way to solve a problem. To clarify, its simple a rule of thumb that people can follow to solve a general pool of problems. We see design patterns all around us, starting from when we were adolescents. An example I just came up while doing laundry was how I shake/flap my clean clothes after it comes out of the dryer. This method is widely used so that the clothes do not stay wrinkly. How can such things apply to software engineering? In my current project called Math Rush, a live multiplayer math game, there was a clear separation in the logic behind the codes and the interface of the actual application. This is an example of the Model-View-Control. A simpler example is ESLint and the text editor IntelliJ. The text editor uses certain guidelines and best practices to determine what syntax errors could happen within the code. Using a text editor implements the design pattern to avoid general mistakes most programmers make such as syntax, formatting, and maybe even forgetting a semi colon.

All in all, design patterns are all around us, not just in the realm of software engineering. The best part is, most things in our daily lives are so overlooked that we don’t even realize that it was the hard work of those before us that figured out these design patterns. I can’t imagine trying to iron out every one of my shirts, or trying to rummage through thousands of lines of code for a simple semi colon error.
