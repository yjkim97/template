Epoch of YuJin is a program that I created over the summer after my first year of ICS classes. It is an interactive novel/adventure game that revolves around a male protagonist who has to save a female character from a tower. This program was created in Java, and utilized a class called EZ.java which is a class created by a graduate student form the University of Hawaii. 

The program has 5 stages. The first stage revolves around getting the protagonist fit enough to rescue the female. With every click, the character did more workouts and became stronger.

After reaching maximum fitness, the character finds himself blocked by a gateguard and must answer a set of questions correctly in order to pass.

Once entered, the character will go through a series of floors that challenges the player in keyboard dexterity and decision making skills. Soon enough, they run into the females parents who interrogates the player until they answer every question correctly.

Once at the top of the tower, the character will find that his evil twin is there. The player will find themselves in the position of the female character, and must make a decision on who to shoot down. 

Depending on which character is shot, the ending credits will be different. 

This program consisted of over 14000 lines of code. Everything from the art to the animations were created by me, with the help of the EZ.java class. Music was also selected and used to enhance the experience. This project took approximately 2 months to carry out.
