ASCII Art Creator turns any .png file into a beautiful ASCII art.

This application analyzes the RGB patterns of a picture. By turning the colors into numerics, this application then turns each value into a given ascii character. Numbers representing darker colors will be translated to "filling" characters such as 'X'. Pixels with lighter colors are translated to smaller characters such as ','.

This was a team based project that took approximately 2 months. Although it is still in its early stages, there is a lot of vision on what we want this project to look like in the future. Functionalities such as being able to connect with other students for study sessions, multiplayer math games, and student-teacher connections are just a few things of what Math Rush will consist of.
