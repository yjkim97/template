summary: A MineSweeper game developed using GUI's

For my ICS 211 class, I worked with another student to create a MineSweeper game through GUI's.

Our program allowed the user to choose between 3 different levels, each with an increased amount of buttons and mines. Once the game starts, a timer will keep track of how long it takes to either win the game or lose. The program also kept track of the previous attempts and their scores.

This project involved a lot of recursion. Once someone clicked on an open field, recursion was used to check the surrounding buttons. Because Mine Sweeper will automatically clear any empty spaces that are adjacent to the button pressed, it was difficult to replicate that using recursion. Thankfully, my partner was very familiar with the concept so she was able to figure it out. As for me, I was very good at working with GUI's. Our strengths were able to cover our weaknesses and this project turned out to be a success.
