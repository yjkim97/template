# The Dank Bank Database

The Dank Bank Database allows users to create a bank account, deposit/withdraw funds, and transfer funds throughout users.

## Table of Contents

* [Installation and running the application](#install)
* [User Guide](#user)
* [Sample Run](#test)

## Installation and running the application <a name="install"></a>

First, clone or download a copy of the [Dank Bank Database](https://github.com/yjkim97/BankDatabase).

Second, cd to the appropriate folder and run the following lines of code:

```
gcc -c main.c
gcc main.o -o DankBank
./DankBank
```

## User Guide <a name="user"></a>

The Dank Bank Database utilizes the file "save.txt" as a source to store database information. For the best results, ensure that this file is empty.

Once starting the application, the menu will prompt the user to choose between 3 options.

Option 1 will allow the user to log in to any existing accounts. Enter the number "1" and log in using the following credentials:
